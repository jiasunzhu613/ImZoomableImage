ImZoomableImage
=====

### Dependencies
This widget was made for [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui). Dear ImGui installations instructions can be found in the linked repo.

For information on how images are loaded and displayed in Dear ImGui, check out this [wiki page](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Image-Loading-and-Displaying-Examples)!

### Usage 
To use this widget you can simply copy the function in ImZoomableImage.cpp into your main source files or you can add ImZoomableImage.h and ImZoomableImage.cpp into your working directory. 
The _ImZoomableImage_ widget is identical to the Image widget in ImGui except with the added functionality to zoom in and out of the image and drag the zoomed-in image. 

Since ImZoomableImage is based on the Image widget in ImGui, feel free to check out the [Image widget documentation](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/cc40ae2101acd1fb4e0585a46198e6fd12960617/imgui_widgets.cpp) for additional information.
